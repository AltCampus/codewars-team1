## Usage
Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```
Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
Push the branch on github :

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set upstream.

You can see all branches created by using :
```
$ git branch -a
```
